		<h3>Instructions:</h3>

		<div class = "bbb">
			<ol>
				<li>
				<span class = "emph">Saute aromatics & make the roux: </span> Saute the onion + garlic over NORMAL heat settings on SAUTE function. Add the flour (only if you own an older model Instant Pot, otherwise skip the flour now) and saute for 30 seconds.
				</li>
				<li><span class = "emph">Pressure cook broccoli: </span> Add carrots and all the seasonings. Mix well and also de-glaze the pot very well scraping the sides and the bottom of the pot with a spatula to loosen any stuck food particles. This will prevent the BURN error and itâ€™s a very important step! </li>
				<li><span class = "emph">Add dairy and cheese:</span> Add the cream. Mix well. Grab a potato masher and mash a few cooked brocolis if you prefer a soup with added body but still chunky. Turn off the instant pot. Add the cheease in 2-3 batches and stir well with a spatula to help incorporate and melt the cheese very well into the soup. </li>
